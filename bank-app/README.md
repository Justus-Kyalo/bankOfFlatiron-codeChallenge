# FlatironBankApp
![screenshort](https://github.com/RemmyKyalo/bankOfFlatiron-codeChallenge/blob/main/image/app.png)

- This is a simple React app that allows users to view, search, and add bank transactions to a table. 
- The app is built with the following features:

- A Search Bar that allows users to filter transactions by category. The search results are fetched from a local json server API at https://remmykyalo.github.io/transactions.json.
- A Form that allows users to add new transactions to the table. The form data is added to the transaction list and rendered on the DOM in real-time.
- A Table that displays all the transactions fetched from the json server API or added on submit.
# Executing App on local machine
- To run the app, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies
- Start the json-server by running json-server --watch db.json in the root of the project
- In a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory and run npm start to start the development server
- The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000
# Dependencies
